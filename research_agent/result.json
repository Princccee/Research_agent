    "Overview": "Ola Consumer, headquartered in Bangalore, is an Indian transportation company primarily known for its ride-hailing services. Founded in 2010 as Olatrip.com, it pivoted to on-demand cabs in 2011 as Ola Cabs. Launching its mobile app in 2012, Ola rapidly expanded, acquiring rival TaxiForSure in 2015. The company ventured into international markets in 2018, including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. However, in 2024, Ola exited these markets to refocus on India. August 2024 saw the company rebrand to Ola Consumer, reflecting its diversification into other business verticals such as financial services and cloud kitchens, alongside its core transportation offerings. It currently operates in over 250 Indian cities.\n",
