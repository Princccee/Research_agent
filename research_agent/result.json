    "Overview": "Ola Consumer, formerly Ola Cabs, is an Indian transportation company headquartered in Bangalore, primarily known for its ride-hailing services. Founded in 2011 as a taxi aggregator, Ola expanded its services to include financial services and cloud kitchens. Supported by investors like Softbank, Ola initially saw rapid growth, acquiring rival TaxiForSure in 2015 and gaining significant market share. Between 2018 and 2019, Ola expanded internationally into Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. However, in April 2024, the company announced its withdrawal from all international markets to refocus on its core Indian operations. The company rebranded to Ola Consumer in August 2024 to reflect its broadened offerings.\n",

                "explanation": "AI/ML models can analyze real-time data (time of day, location, weather, events, traffic) and historical data to predict demand fluctuations. This allows Ola to dynamically adjust pricing, optimizing revenue and driver availability in high-demand areas while offering competitive prices in low-demand areas. This helps balance supply and demand more efficiently.",
                "practical_application": [
                    "Implement an AI-powered pricing engine that automatically adjusts fares based on predicted demand. This could be displayed to both riders and drivers via the app in real time."

AI can also predict optimal driver assignments by matching drivers to ride requests based on location, availability, driver performance, and passenger preferences (e.g., ratings). This reduces ride times, fuel consumption, and improves driver efficiency.",

                    "Develop an AI-driven route planning and driver assignment system that uses real-time traffic data and predictive modeling to minimize travel time and optimize driver utilization."

In customer service, AI-powered chatbots can handle routine inquiries, resolving common issues quickly and efficiently, while escalating more complex issues to human agents.",
