    "Overview": "Ola Consumer, formerly Ola Cabs, is an Indian transportation company headquartered in Bangalore, primarily known for its ride-hailing services across 250+ Indian cities. Founded in 2011 as a taxi aggregator by Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati, Ola transitioned from phone bookings to a mobile app by 2012. The company rapidly expanded, achieving market leadership by 2015 and acquiring rival TaxiForSure. Ola ventured into international markets like Australia, New Zealand, and the UK starting in 2018. However, in April 2024, Ola exited all international operations to refocus on the Indian market. In August 2024, the company rebranded to Ola Consumer, reflecting its diversification into financial services and cloud kitchens alongside its core transportation business.\n",
