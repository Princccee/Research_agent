    "Overview": "Uber Technologies, founded in 2009, is a multinational transportation company headquartered in San Francisco. Its core business revolves around its technology platform, which provides ride-hailing, courier services, food delivery, and freight transport. Beginning as a solution for costly and difficult transportation, Uber connects riders and customers with independent drivers and carriers through mobile applications.\n\nSince its inception, Uber has grown to operate in approximately 70 countries and 15,000 cities, amassing over 150 million monthly active users and coordinating an average of 28 million trips daily. In 2023, the company reported a take rate of 28.7% for mobility services and 18.3% for food delivery.\n",
